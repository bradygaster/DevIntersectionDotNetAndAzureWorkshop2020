# Workshop: Advanced .NET, Containers and Azure 

This workshop will walk .NET customers through all the options for hosting their code in Azure using Windows, Linux and Containers. You will learn how to develop locally on Windows and Linux and containers and then publish and diagnose your applications in Azure. Next we will take a deep dive into building API’s and gPRC services in .NET that can be called from all platforms. Including developing API’s that can be tested on the local development box with the application running in Azure. And finally we will dive into some of the new capabilities in .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 to make your web services into single file executables that are both small and easy to host. Each section will cover a topic and then have exercises you can go through on your own computer. When your done you should understand how to build API’s and services, host them in the variety of options that Azure provides and build small and performant API’s.

## Agenda

Below is a snap shot of the material we intend on covering. Between each presentation segment, attendees will have opportunities to work on homework specific to what they've just seen in the presentation. 

When you get to each homework segment, clilck the link labelled `Homework Break` for that segment. You'll be linked into a sub-directory of this repository. Within each homework break subdirectory, you'll find a `readme.md` file containing instructions on how to complete the homework. This way you'll get to try out the things you've seen here right away, with members of the team in the room to help, should you run into any issues along the way.
